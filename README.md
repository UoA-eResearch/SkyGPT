# SkyGPT: Probabilistic Short-term Solar Forecasting Using Synthetic Sky Videos from Physics-constrained VideoGPT

(Include a demonstration animation here)

The variability of solar photovoltaic (PV) output, driven by rapidly changing cloud dynamics, hinders the transition to reliable renewable energy systems. With the recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, synthesis of possible images of the future sky has potential for aiding in forecasts of PV power output. Here, we introduce *SkyGPT*, a physics-constrained stochastic video prediction model, to generate plausible future sky videos with diverse cloud motion patterns based on past sky image sequences. We demonstrate the potential of using the synthetic future sky images for a 15-minute-ahead probabilistic PV output forecasting task using real-world power generation data from a 30-kW rooftop PV system.
